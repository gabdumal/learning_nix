This is the official documentation of the Nix language, and can be accessed at [nix.dev](https://nix.dev).

The chapters of the book are represented on a hierarchical structure.

Each exercise has a different folder, which includes the needed files.

Each file can be interpreted with the following command:

```bash
nix-instantiate --eval --strict file.nix
```
